# Platt Electric Challenge
This is a repository for the coding challenge given by Platt Electric

## Purpose

1. Create a simple web project using ASP .NET Core 2.0 or higher. 
   - The subject can be anything of your choosing, but must be original code written solely by you.

2. The project must demonstrate the ability to interact with a SQL database by both retrieving and storing data. 
   - (We don’t need a copy of the actual database or the ability to connect to it. We’ll be able to evaluate the code just fine without the database.)

3. The project must implement at least 3 different controller methods and associated views. 
   - At least one of these must capture user input and insert data into a database and check for invalid user input.

4. For this position, we don’t care how beautiful the front-end code is, so don’t invest any more time than necessary with the HTML/CSS side of things. 
   - Instead, impress us with your C# code. Show us what you can do!

5. Place your completed project in a new repository in your GitHub account and provide us a link to the repository.

## Description

In this project, I created a simple web page using ASP.Net Core 3.0. This website contains simple CRUD operations for a data model called "RPGClasses". The first page to appear when the project is running is a List of the current objects in the database.
